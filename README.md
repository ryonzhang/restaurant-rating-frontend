# Restaurant Rating Frontend

This project is to develop a restaurant rating system with the following features 


## Requirements

User must be able to create an account and log in. (If a mobile application, this means that more users can use the app from the same phone).
Implement 3 roles with different permission levels
 * Regular User: Can rate and leave a comment for a restaurant
 * Owner: Can create restaurants and reply comments about owned restaurants
 * Admin: Can edit/delete all users, restaurants, comments, and reviews
Reviews should have:
 * A 5 star based rate
 * Date of the visit
 * Comment 
When a Regular User logs in he will see a Restaurant List ordered by Rate Average
When an Owner logs in he will see a Restaurant List only the ones owned by him, and the reviews pending to reply
Owners can reply the review once
Restaurants detailed view should have:
 * The overall average rating
 * The highest rated review
 * The lowest rated review
 * Last reviews with rate, comment, and reply
Restaurant List can be filtered by Rating
REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you don’t know how to create your own backend you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
In any case, you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly. Please be prepared to use REST clients like Postman, cURL, etc. for this purpose.

## Architecture

### Language

This project utilizes React framework in defining pages including dashboard/home with login/logout functions and restaurants and users list.

### Authentication and Authorization

Auth0 is used in issuing tokens based on roles and permissions and also rbac-rules.js defines very fine-grained access control of user.
