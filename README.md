# Restaurant Rating Frontend

This project is to develop a restaurant rating system with the following features 


## Requirements

User must be able to create an account and log in. (If a mobile application, this means that more users can use the app from the same phone).
Implement 3 roles with different permission levels
 * Regular User: Can rate and leave a comment for a restaurant
 * Owner: Can create restaurants and reply comments about owned restaurants
 * Admin: Can edit/delete all users, restaurants, comments, and reviews
Reviews should have:
 * A 5 star based rate
 * Date of the visit
 * Comment 
When a Regular User logs in he will see a Restaurant List ordered by Rate Average
When an Owner logs in he will see a Restaurant List only the ones owned by him, and the reviews pending to reply
Owners can reply the review once
Restaurants detailed view should have:
 * The overall average rating
 * The highest rated review
 * The lowest rated review
 * Last reviews with rate, comment, and reply
Restaurant List can be filtered by Rating
REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you donâ€™t know how to create your own backend you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
In any case, you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly. Please be prepared to use REST clients like Postman, cURL, etc. for this purpose.

## Architecture

### Language

This project utilizes React framework in defining pages including dashboard/home with login/logout functions and restaurants and users list.

### Authentication and Authorization

Auth0 is used in issuing tokens based on roles and permissions and also rbac-rules.js defines very fine-grained access control of user.
